# Nomie Stopwatch

This plug-in is designed to augment the current timer system in Nomie v6. I created this to make it easier to associate specific timer events to other trackers. For example, I can use this to track how long I take to shower and then prompt a list tracker when the timer is stopped to get information about the temperature of the water and what soaps I used.
